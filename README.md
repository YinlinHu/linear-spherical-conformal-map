spherical_conformal_map: Conformally map a genus-0 closed triangle mesh to the unit sphere

This code computes spherical conformal (i.e. angle-preserving) maps of genus-0 closed triangle meshes using the linear method in [1], which has been applied for human brain mapping, texture mapping, surface registration, cardiac mapping and so on.
Any comments and suggestions are welcome.
